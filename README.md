The premise of this project is to produce a single page web application. I have decided to create a page that functions as a business page for a business that is a gift wrapping service. 

JSON Server was used for information being displayed on the page.

As a customer, I should be able to perform the following actions :
    1- Mouseover the different tiles and get a description of a different type of services available.
    2- The middle tile will offer text for more information and when clicked it should reveal a form that the potential customer can fillout an order on.
    3- The footer should allow me to enter testimonials of the service I received and a rating of stars for future customers to see.

Logo Design was done by me using Affinity Designer.

JSON Server was used instead of an API. The db.json runs on port 3000 by default. However, I found myself needing to add a second .json file and decided to have JSON server watch it on port 4000.
