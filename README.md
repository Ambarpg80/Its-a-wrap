The premise of this project is to produce a single page web application. I have decided to create a page that functions as a business page for a business that is a gift wrapping service. 

As a customer, I should be able to perform the following actions :
    1- Mouseover the different tiles and get a description of a different type of services available.
    2- The middle tile will offer text for more information and when clicked it should reveal a form that the potential customer can fillout an order on.
    3- The footer should allow me to enter testimonials of the service I received and a rating of stars for future customers to see.
